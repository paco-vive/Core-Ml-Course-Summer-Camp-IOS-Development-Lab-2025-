# CoreML SwiftUI App

Educational SwiftUI app demonstrating how to integrate **two Core ML models** for object and landscape recognition, used in the **Summer Camp iOS Development Lab 2025** to teach beginners image selection, preprocessing, and prediction display.

## ðŸ“š Educational Context
This code was used in the **Summer Camp iOS Development Lab 2025** to teach beginner students how to:
- Connect a Core ML model with SwiftUI.
- Select images from the photo library.
- Preprocess images for computer vision models.
- Display prediction results clearly in the UI.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Image selection** from the gallery using `UIImagePickerController` adapted to SwiftUI.
- **Automatic conversion** from `UIImage` to `CVPixelBuffer` for model input.
- **Core ML integration** with the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model.
- **Displays the main prediction** and the **top 4 most probable predictions** with percentages.
- **Beginner-friendly UI** designed for educational purposes.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI** â€“ For building the user interface.
- **Core ML** â€“ To run machine learning models on-device.
- **MobileNetV2** â€“ Pre-trained image classification model.
- **UIKit bridge** (`UIViewControllerRepresentable`) â€“ To integrate the image picker into SwiftUI.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
CoreMLSwiftUIApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ ContentView.swift # Main view and prediction logic
â”œâ”€â”€ ImagePicker.swift # SwiftUI adapter for image selection
â””â”€â”€ UIImage+PixelBuffer.swift# Extension for UIImage to CVPixelBuffer conversion


## ðŸ“¸ How It Works
1. Open the app.
2. Tap the image icon to select a photo from your gallery.
3. The app analyzes the image using the model and shows:
   - The main prediction.
   - The top 4 most probable predictions with percentages.
